# h2n

This public repository is a place holder for the latest version of the
code for the Perl 5 program *h2n*.  *h2n* is a Perl 5 utility program
which is discussed in the book *DNS and BIND*, by Cricket Liu and Paul
Albitz, and published by *O'Reilly Media, Inc.*

After a query of the audience on reddit to see if anyone knew of the
license status of *h2n*, I got a message from Cricket Liu
(<https://www.reddit.com/r/dns/comments/4lp7v9/cricket_lius_perl_program_h2n/d3rwex6?context=3>)
which said the program came from HP (with permission) and included a
link to <ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/h2n/h2n.tar.gz>.  When going to the
ftp site I found file <ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/h2n/h2n-2.61rc8> which
does contain licensing info which is quoted here:
